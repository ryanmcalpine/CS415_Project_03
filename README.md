# CS415_Project_03
By Ryan McAlpine & Nicholas Keng

When the program is executed, the user is asked to select one of the 
three options. Enter (a) for bst, (b) for 2-3 tree, or (c) to compare both.
Then follow the prompt. 

Things that didn't work:
We were unable to implement promotion/splitting parent node if 
it already has 2 keys. The logic should still work if there are less than 
2 keys.
